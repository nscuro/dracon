# deps.dev Enricher

This enricher implements a rudimentary client for Google's [Open Source Insights](https://deps.dev) project.
It *ONLY* works with issues containing SBOMs and at its current version adds missing licensing information to each package in the SBOM.


## Future steps

When/If there is interest around this enricher we can add more information retrieval such as Security Advisories.
